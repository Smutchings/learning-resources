# Hey folks.
I created this repo because I love learning. Growing up we didn't have a lot of money so I had to figure out how to study things without it. I found that the best and most efficient way for me to learn was to observe and then teach myself how to do it. I'd watch people do things and then do my research using materials that were and could be available to me through others. That meant asking a lot of questions, rummaging through old boxes and dusty stacks at the school library, and spending long hours in front of the tv digesting educational materials on free channels. This was before the Internet and the open source movement. Everything I used to learn were borrowed and very often they were outdated and in bad shape.

**Now you can learn anything you want without restrictions** **_first-hand_**. All you need is an internet connection and you're golden. Resources are constantly updated and most likely to have more than one version out there so you'll never have to worry about the quality of information you can access. This, more than anything, is why I love being on the web and one of the reasons I decided to get into it professionally. That was sealed when I got offered my first ever gig in web development a few weeks ago after relentlessly studying design and development on my own for months.

So to celebrate I compiled a list of resources that I personally have used to get me where I am today. You can check it out here: http://github.com/hedr/learning-resources/blob/master/unicorn.md

I'm also learning music in a much more structured and I guess scholarly way than just playing by ear which is what I've been doing my whole entire life since I taught myself to play guitar in 4th grade so if you're into that and want to follow along, I made a list for that too: http://github.com/hedr/learning-resources/blob/master/music.md

I'll add more as I go along. Hope they help you the way they helped me!
